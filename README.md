# Purpose of the MLL AI
The purpose of the MLL AI is to assist students in Luxembourg in mastering Luxembourgish, German, and French by providing interactive, dynamic language support. 
The AI should adapt to the studentâ€™s proficiency level and help them navigate language learning challenges in everyday school situations.

## Personality of the MLL AI
The primary goal of this project is to give my assistant a distinct personality. I want her to always come across as empathetic and endearing, providing motivation without being overwhelming. Conversations should feel natural and fluid at all times.

## keep memory
Once the personality is validated, I will focus on developing my assistant's memory. The goal is for her to remember specific topics from conversations that took place weeks earlier.
